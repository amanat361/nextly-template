Real-time data synchronization has become a game-changer in modern application development, enabling applications to deliver live updates and interactive features. Supabase capitalizes on PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism to bring real-time capabilities to your applications seamlessly.

When a change is made to a table in the database, such as an insert, update, or delete operation, PostgreSQL's NOTIFY feature is triggered. Supabase then captures this notification and pushes it to connected clients, allowing them to stay in sync with the latest changes.

### Using PostgreSQL as a Real-time Database

To demonstrate how easy it is to work with real-time data using Supabase, let's consider a simple example. Imagine you're building a collaborative to-do list application where multiple users can add and complete tasks in real time.

1. **Database Setup:**
   Create a table named `tasks` with columns such as `id`, `title`, `completed`, and `user_id`.

2. **Real-time Subscription:**
   Set up a real-time subscription to the `tasks` table using Supabase's JavaScript client library.

   ```javascript
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

   const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project-url.supabase.co';
   const supabaseKey = 'your-api-key';
   const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

   const subscription = supabase
     .from('tasks')
     .on('INSERT', payload => {
       console.log('New task added:', payload.new);
     })
     .subscribe();
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   Whenever a new task is added to the `tasks` table, the subscription callback will be triggered, allowing you to update the UI in real time.

### Setting Up Real-time Subscriptions

Setting up real-time subscriptions using Supabase is remarkably straightforward:

1. **Define Subscription:**
   Use the `.on()` method on a Supabase query to specify the type of database operation you want to listen for (e.g., `'INSERT'`, `'UPDATE'`, `'DELETE'`).

2. **Subscribe:**
   Call the `.subscribe()` method on the query to start receiving real-time updates.

3. **Handle Updates:**
   In the subscription callback, you can handle the incoming data and update your application's state or UI accordingly.
